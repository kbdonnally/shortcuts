# Download Assets from Webpage

- Combine functionality of "view source" with Python extensions

- Download and save a webpage + their CSS/JS files so you have a local copy fully. (Bothers me so much to not have the CSS unless they give absolute links or put it in the `<head>`!

- Not super sure how to do this yet...tbd!
