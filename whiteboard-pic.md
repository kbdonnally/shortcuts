# Whiteboard Pics

- Wanted way to automate putting those photos in the album so I'd actually bother to do so

- Can be extrapolated for other pics taken for strategic purpose (eg design inspo pics).

## Rough instructions:

1. Open camera
2. Capture image
3. Auto-save image to album "Whiteboard Pics"
  - Add output of image capture to album
  - Set album to [name]
  - Save explicitly if needed
4. Exit
